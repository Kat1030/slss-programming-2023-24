# Natural Language Processing

## Output

We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen
We can use the print ( ) function to display output

```python
print("Your text goes in here")
```

## [[Headers]]

## Comments

Comments are pieces of text that are not interpreted by Python
This means that the text is **ignored**
We use the hash (#) symbol to make comments

```python
# This is a comment
```
