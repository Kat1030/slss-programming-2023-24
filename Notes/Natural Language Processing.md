# Natural Language Processing

## Output

We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen
We can use the print ( ) function to display output

```python
print("Your text goes in here")
```





## Comments

Comments are pieces of text that are not interpreted by Python
This means that the text is **ignored**
We use the hash (#) symbol to make comments

```python
# This is a comment
```


## Input

We grab information from the user using `input()
When we run the function, it does two things:
1. It waits for the user to write something or nothing
2. The user presses **Enter/Return** to indicate that they're finished

```python
input()

input(<prompt>)
```


## Variables

Variables allow us to store information for the time that our app is running

```python
favourite_food = input("What is your favourite food?")
```

`favourite_food` --> name of the variable
`=` --> assignment operator
`input...` --> value

### Naming

What you can do:
1. Name them with letters, numbers, and underscores
2. Names **should** start with a lowercase letter

What you can't do:
1. You **can't** name them with spaces or symbols
2. You **can't** name them with certain names that are reserved
	1. e.g. `if, while, for, and, or, ...`

A good name is something like this:

```python
favourite_food
fave_food
date_of_birth
student_number
```

Bad names are like this:

```python
Favourite_food
a
num
aa
aaa
aaaa
```
