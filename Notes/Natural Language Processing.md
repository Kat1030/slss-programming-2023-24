# Natural Language Processing

## Output

We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen
We can use the print ( ) function to display output

```python
print("Your text goes in here")
```


## [[Headers]]


## Comments

Comments are pieces of text that are not interpreted by Python
This means that the text is **ignored**
We use the hash (#) symbol to make comments

```python
# This is a comment
```


## Input

We grab information from the user using `input()
When we run the function, it does two things:
1. It waits for the user to write something or nothing
2. The user presses **Enter/Return** to indicate that they're finished

```python
input()

input(<prompt>)
```


## Variables

Variables allow us to store information for the time that our app is running

```python
favourite_food = input("What is your favourite food?")
```

`favourite_food` --> name of the variable
`=` --> assignment operator
`input...` --> value


## [[Strings]]
