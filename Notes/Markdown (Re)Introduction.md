# Headings

We create headings in Markdown using hash (#) symbols
To create subheadings, we can use multiple hash (#) symbols
## This is a level two subheading

### This is a level three subheading

###### This is a level 6 subheading



# Modifying Text Style

## Bold and Italics
We use asterisks (\*) to modify text styling, specifically bold and italics

e.g.
I want this **word** specifically to be bold
I want this *word* to be italicized
I want this ***word*** to be both bold and italicized

## Escape Characters
**ASIDE**: If we want to place a character that is a *keyword* or *reserved word*, and we want the LITERAL character, use the forward slash (\\)
	e.g. if we want to put an asterisk, we do this   \\\*

## Strikethrough
We can also strikethrough characters using the tilde (~)

e.g.
I want to strikethrough this specific ~~word~~
~~This sentence is struck through~~



# Links

We can link things in our Markdown files
[One tool to use.](https://chat.openai.com)

Exercise:
* If you have an OpenAI account, do the following:
	* Ask ChatGPT to create for you Markdown code that is a link to two websites of your choice
		* e.g. [A search engine](https://nyt.com) *from ChatGPT*
* If your don't have ChatGPT/OpenAI create two links to websites of your choice in the space below
	* e.g. [My favourite website right now](https://google.com)

[My most used social media](https://www.instagram.com)

[My favourite music platform](https://open.spotify.com)



# Images

## Method One

e.g.
![Cheetah](http://elelur.com/data_images/mammals/cheetah/cheetah-02.jpg)

## Method Two Doesn't Work

e.g.
![Cheetah](cheetahpic)
cheetapic (http://elelur.com/data_images/mammals/cheetah/cheetah-02.jpg)


# Blockquotes

Blockquotes allow us to emphasize a bigger chunk of text
We use carets (>) to create blockquotes

e.g.
> This is an example of a blockquote
> This is line two of the blockquote
>
> This is the fourth line; the third is blank


# Lists

We can create both unordered and ordered lists

## Unordered Lists

To create each point, we use (\*) with a space behind it
We can create sublists by placing **TABS** before the asterisk

e.g.
* dairy
	* eggs
	* milk
	* cheese
* juice

## Ordered Lists

If there is a specific order to the elements in our list, we create ordered lists
We use numbers, followed by periods to create ordered lists

e.g.
1. Put butter into mixing bowl
2. Add sugar to butter
   Add both brown and regular sugar
3. Use the mixer to cream the butter and sugar together


# Tables

We can organize information in tables using Markdown
We use dashes (-) and pipes (|)

Tables in Markdown require headings

e.g.

| Name        | Age     | Sign        | Superpower   |
| ---         | ---     | ---         | ---          |
| Bruce Wayne | 35      | Aquarius    | Intelligence |
| Mr. Ubial   | Unaging | All of them | Dad Strength |
| Katrina     | 14      | Scorpio     | Throwing     |
